# In this tutorial we will go back to mathematics and study statistics, and how to calculate important numbers based on data sets.
#
# We will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers we need.
#
# And we will learn how to make functions that are able to predict the outcome based on what we have learned.

# In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.
#
# Example of an array:
#
# [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]


# Data Types
# To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with.
#
# We can split the data types into three main categories:
#
# Numerical
# Categorical
# Ordinal
# Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:
#
# Discrete Data
# - numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
# Continuous Data
# - numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item
# Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.
#
# Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.
#
# By knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what technique to use when analyzing them.
#
# You will learn more about statistics and analyzing data in the next chapters.
