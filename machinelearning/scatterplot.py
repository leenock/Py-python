# Scatter Plot
# A scatter plot is a diagram where each value in the data set is represented by a dot.

# The Matplotlib module has a method for drawing scatter plots, it needs two arrays of the same length, one for the values of the x-axis, and one for the values of the y-axis:

# The x array represents the age of each car.
#
# The y array represents the speed of each car.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [5,7,8,7,2,17,2,9,4,11,12,9,6]
y = [99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()

# Scatter Plot Explained
# The x-axis represents ages, and the y-axis represents speeds.
#
# What we can read from the diagram is that the two fastest cars were both 2 years old, and the slowest car was 12 years old.

# Random Data Distributions
# In Machine Learning the data sets can contain thousands-, or even millions, of values.
#
# You might not have real world data when you are testing an algorithm, you might have to use randomly generated values.
#
# As we have learned in the previous chapter, the NumPy module can help us with that!
#
# Let us create two arrays that are both filled with 1000 random numbers from a normal data distribution.
#
# The first array will have the mean set to 5.0 with a standard deviation of 1.0.
#
# The second array will have the mean set to 10.0 with a standard deviation of 2.0:


import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = numpy.random.normal(5.0, 1.0, 1000)
y = numpy.random.normal(10.0, 2.0, 1000)

plt.scatter(x, y)
plt.show()

# Scatter Plot Explained
# We can see that the dots are concentrated around the value 5 on the x-axis, and 10 on the y-axis.
#
# We can also see that the spread is wider on the y-axis than on the x-axis.
