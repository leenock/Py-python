# What is Standard Deviation?
# Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.
#
# A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.
#
# A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.
#
# Example: This time we have registered the speed of 7 cars:
# speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]

# The standard deviation is:
#
# 0.9
#
# Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 0.9 from the mean value, which is 86.4.


# Let us do the same with a selection of numbers with a wider range:
#
# speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]
#
# The standard deviation is:
#
# 37.85
#
# Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 37.85 from the mean value, which is 77.4.
#
# As you can see, a higher standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.
#
# The NumPy module has a method to calculate the standard deviation:

# Use the NumPy std() method to find the standard deviation:

import numpy

speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]

x = numpy.std(speed)

print(x)

import numpy

speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]

x = numpy.std(speed)

print(x)
